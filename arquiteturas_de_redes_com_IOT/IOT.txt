	- GATEWAY: É um dispositivo (hardware ou software) que interliga redes diferentes, permitindo a comunicação entre sistemas que usam diferentes protocolos.
FUNÇÕES PRINCIPAIS:
- Conversão de endereços e protocolos
- Encaminhamento de tráfego entre redes
- Implementação de regras de segurança

	- FIREWALL: O firewall protege a rede bloqueando ou permitindo tráfego com base em regras de segurança.
FUNÇÕES PRINCIPAIS:
- Filtragem de pacotes
- Bloqueio de acessos não autorizados
- Monitoramento de tráfego e logs
TIPOS DE FIREWALL:
- Firewall de software: Instalado em sistemas operacionais (exemplo: Windows Defender, IPTables no Linux)
- Firewall de hardware: Equipamentos dedicados que protegem redes corporativas

	- TRANSCEIVER - TRANSCEPTOR/CONVERSOR: São dispositivos responsáveis pela conversão e transmissão de sinais ópticos ou elétricos em redes de comunicação. Eles são usados para conectar switches, roteadores e outros equipamentos.


MODELOS E PROTOCOLOS DE REDES - Servem como uma estrutura conceitual para descrever como a comunicação ocorre entre dispositivos. Dois modelos principais: Modelo OSI e Modelo TCP/IP. Definem as regras e padrões de comunicação.

Modelo OSI: Física (responsável pela transmissão física) -> Enlace (organiza os pacotes físicos, que seram enviados pela camada física) -> Rede -> Transporte (garante que todos os fragmentos sejam enviados e recebidos) -> Sessão (estabelece uma conexão entre as máquinas) -> Apresentação (responsável por tranformar os dados, como criptografar algo) -> Aplicação
Modelo TCP/IP: Acesso a rede -> Internet -> Transporte -> Aplicação

IMPORTÂNCIA DOS PROTOCOLOS DE REDES:
- Garantem que dispositivos diferentes possam se comunicar
- Definem regras como endereçamento, formatação de dados e controle de erros
- Exemplos: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP, IP, comunicação

ARQUITETURA TCP/IP
Camadas:
- Aplicação: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
- Transporte: TCP, UDP
- Internet: IP, ICMP
- Acesso à rede: Ethernet, Wi-Fi

Comparativo com o Modelo OSI:
TCP/IP foi desenvolvido para a internet e é mais prático do que o modelo OSI

IPv4 e IPv6
- IPv4(Internet Protocol version 4) é a quarta versão do Protocolo de Internet, amplamente utilizado para identificação e localização de dispositivos na rede. Foi desenvolvido nos anos 1980 e se tornou o padrão para comunicação na Internet. IMPORTÂNCIA: IPv4 é a base da maioria das redes atuais, sendo responsável por permitir a comunicação entre dispositivos de forma confiável e eficiente.


ESTRUTURA DE ENDEREÇO - Um endereço IPv4 é um número de 32 bits, dividido em quatro octetos. Representado em notação decimal com pontos.
192.168.1.12
11000000. 10101000. 00000001. 00001100

CONVERSÃO:
Exemplo: 10.253.1.111

    | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
    |     |    |    |    |   |   |   |   |
10  |  0  |  0 |  0 |  0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
253 |  1  |  1 |  1 |  1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
1   |  0  |  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
111 |  0  |  1 |  1 |  0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Transforme os endereços IPv4 abaixo em binário:
a)172.16.0.194
10101100. 00010000. 00000000. 11000010

b)10.108.200.33
00001010. 01101100. 11001000. 00100001

c)192.169.253.45
11000000. 10101001. 11111101. 00101101

d)35.215.58.98
00100191. 11010111. 00111010. 01100010

e)173.253.227.4
10101101. 11111101. 11100011. 00000100

CLASSES DE ENDEREÇOS:
- Classe A: Endereços de 0.0.0.0 a 127.255.255.255. Grandes redes, com poucos bits para a rede e muitos para os hosts.

- Classe B: Endereços de 128.0.0.0 a 191.255.255.255. Redes de tamanho médio.

- Classe C: Endereços de 192.0.0.0 a 223.255.255.255. Redes pequenas, com muitos bits para a rede e poucos para os hosts.

- Classe D: Endereços de 224.0.0.0 a 239.255.255.255. Usados para multicast.

- Classe E: Endereços de 240.0.0.0 a 255.255.255.255. Reservaods para pesquisas e testes.

ENDEREÇOS ESPECIAIS
Redes locais: Faixas de endereços como:
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255,
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 e
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

são reservadas para uso em redes privadas e não podem ser roteadas na internet
pública.

Multicast: Endereços multicast são usados ​para enviar um único pacote de dados
para um grupo de destinos simultâneos.

Endereço de Loopback: 127.0.0.1. Usado para testar a pilha de rede local.

- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) é a sexta versão do Protocolo de Internet, projetado para substituir o IPv4 devido à exaustão de endereços IP disponíveis no IPv4, IPv6 foi desenvolvido nos anos 1990 e se tornou o padrão emergente para
comunicação na Internet, trazendo várias melhorias em relação ao IPv4.

Importância: IPv6 é crucial para o futuro da Internet, pois oferece um espaço
de endereçamento muito maior. Suporta o crescimento contínuo da Internet e a
proliferação de dispositivos conectados, como smartphones, IoT (Internet das Coisas) e
outros.

ESTRUTURA DE ENDEREÇO - Um endereço IPv6 é um número de 128 bits, dividido em oito grupos de 16 bits, chamado de duocteto. Cada grupo é representado por 4 dígitos hexadecimais (O-F)
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334



MÁSCARAS DE SUB-REDE:

Uma máscara de sub-rede é usada para dividir uma rede IP em sub-redes
menores, o que facilita a organização e o gerenciamento da rede. Ela define qual
parte do endereço IP é a parte da rede e qual parte é a parte do host (TUDO QUE EU CONECTO NA MINHA REDE É UM HOST). A notação
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) é uma maneira de representar a máscara de
sub-rede, como /24, que indica que os primeiros 24 bits do endereço IP são usados
para a rede.

Rede Original: 192.168.1.0/24

•Endereço IP: 192.168.1.0
•Máscara de sub-rede: 255.255.255.0 (ou /24)
•Número de endereços na rede: 2^(32-24) = 2^8 = 256
•Endereços disponíveis para hosts: 256 - 2 (rede e broadcast) = 254

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you, heard from you

And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I know exactly where it leads but I watch us go 'round and 'round each time

'Cause you got that James Jean daydream look in your eye, and I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time 'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style3

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go), we never go out of style
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh, whoa, oh
(Out of style)
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (now we go), we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

---------------------------------------- STORY OF US -----------------------------------------

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The end

------------------------------------------ DEAR JOHN --------------------------------------------
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known

----------------------------------------- SPEAK NOW -------------------------------------------
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don't you?
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"
I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you'll say, "Let's run away now"
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now"

------------------------------------- BACK TO DECEMBER -----------------------------------
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleepin'
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreamin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time

-------------------------------------------- RED -----------------------------------------------
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know
Somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know
Somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know
Somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
Burning red
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street

------------------------------------------ FEARLESS --------------------------------------------
There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh, yeah
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
Oh, oh
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless
Oh, yeah
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why
But with you I'd dance in a storm
In my best dress
Fearless
Oh, oh, oh yeah

--------------------------------------- OUR SONG -----------------------------------------
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again, play it again
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

-------------------------------------- PICTURE TO BURN --------------------------------------
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really, really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

------------------------------------ STATE OF GRACE ---------------------------------------
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time
And I never (never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never (never)
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never (never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never (never)
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never (never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never
Be the same
And I never (never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never (so you were never a saint)
(And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (we learn to live with the pain)
(Mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

-------------------------------------- ALL TOO WELL ----------------------------------------

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck The Patriarchy keychain on the ground
We were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down: Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

Till we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing, it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece till you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well
But I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened: You
That's what happened: You

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
Willin' you to come
And he said: It's supposed to be fun
Turning twenty-one

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us (just between us) I remember it all too well (wind in my hair)
(I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
